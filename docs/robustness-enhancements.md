# 🛡️ Robustness Enhancements (Future Considerations)

## 📋 Overview
This document tracks potential edge cases and robustness improvements for the DOM parsing system. These are **not immediate priorities** but should be considered for future iterations.

## 🔧 HTML Processing Issues

### Malformed HTML
- **Unclosed tags**: `<div><p>content` (no closing tags)
- **Invalid nesting**: `<p><div>content</div></p>`  
- **Broken encoding**: Special characters, mixed encodings
- **JavaScript-heavy pages**: Minimal initial HTML content

### Potential Solutions
- Pre-process HTML with BeautifulSoup cleanup
- Skip problematic chunks vs. attempt repair
- Fallback to text-only extraction

---

## 🎯 Pattern Discovery Failures

### Common Scenarios
- **No clear patterns found**: Completely unstructured content
- **Conflicting patterns**: Different page sections use different structures  
- **False positives**: LLM identifies irrelevant elements as target data
- **Sparse data**: Target information appears only occasionally

### Recovery Strategies
- Lower confidence thresholds
- Use broader, less specific selectors
- Combine multiple weak patterns

---

## 🧠 Memory Management Edge Cases

### Issues
- **Memory explosion**: Too many false discoveries accumulate
- **Memory starvation**: All patterns get discarded as low-confidence
- **Context loss**: Parent tag tracking becomes inconsistent
- **Circular patterns**: LLM gets stuck in repetitive discoveries

### Mitigation Ideas
- Maximum memory size limits
- Pattern deduplication algorithms
- Context validation mechanisms

---

## 🤖 LLM Response Issues

### Common Problems
- **Hallucinated selectors**: LLM invents CSS/XPath that doesn't exist in HTML
- **Response timeouts**: Claude takes too long to respond
- **Rate limiting**: API quota exceeded
- **Inconsistent responses**: Same chunk produces different results

### Handling Strategies
- Maximum retry limits per chunk
- Fallback to simpler extraction methods
- Human-in-the-loop validation for critical failures
- Selector validation against actual HTML

---

## 📊 Performance & Scalability

### Future Considerations
- Caching learned patterns for similar websites
- Learning from previous extractions
- Processing time optimization
- Memory usage optimization

---

## 🔄 Integration Challenges

### crawl4ai Integration
- Custom extensions beyond standard capabilities
- Multiple extraction strategy support (CSS selectors, XPath, regex)
- Error propagation from extraction to system

*Note: These enhancements should be prioritized based on real-world usage patterns and failure modes encountered during initial implementation.*
